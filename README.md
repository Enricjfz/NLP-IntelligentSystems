Code of the NLP deliverable


This repository contains the code used to perform the NLP deliverable. The
main two files are syuzhet.R and quanteda.R. If you want to use this code,
you must first run the first part of the syuzhet.R, which contains the text
preparation of the 'Quixote' book. There are commentaries indicating where each
part of the code begins and ends. There are some parts of both files which are
not showed in the deliverable. This is because there are some experiments using the
libraries.
